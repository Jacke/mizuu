An Interactive ADT Visualizer

This is a public facing repository to keep track of the project progress and announcements.


What is MIZU?
It is a web app to visualize algorithms and data structure routines live on screen. The user will be able to see it the transformations and data movements as it responds to user events.

A working demo is available on my website.

Mizu goes live in September.

Backend hosts the Server and the Algorithms library which power the simulations on the backend. This Algorithms library houses ADTs based on structures like Tree, Heap, Trie, Queue, Stack, List, and Graph. All of the ADTs in this library are my own implementations. As a function of being an interactive visualizer, the simulations on user side are real-time, not pre-rendered.
